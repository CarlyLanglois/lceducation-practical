==========

A version control system (VCS) is a system which allows programmers to track changes made to code and stores different versions of a code base. 
When programmers make a mistake or want to collaborate, a VCS allows them to roll back to a version without the bug or share their code with each other.

Apart from **collaboration**, VCS assist programmers with keeping backups and a history of all of the revisions made to the code base over time. 

Git is just one VCS and because of its popularity, is what this chapter covers.

.. index:: ! repository, ! commit

Every single VCS has a **repository** for the code and programmers **commit** to that repository.
A repository is the storage container for the code base. In order to update the code in the repository, a programmer commits the new version of the code that is going into the repository.
