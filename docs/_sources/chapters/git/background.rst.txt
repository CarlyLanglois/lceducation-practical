Describe the main functionality provided by a version control system (VCS)
Describe the practical applications of this functionality: revision history, collaboration, backup

A version control system (VCS) is a system which allows programmers to track changes made to code and stores different versions of a code base. 
When programmers make a mistake or want to collaborate, a VCS allows them to roll back to a version without the bug or share their code with each other.
