Merging in Git
==============

.. index:: ! merge

A **merge** in Git is when the code in two branches are brought together.

Before you commit something, you may have realized that there is some work that you never pulled down. That is a time to stash your work so that you can pull in any necessary changes and then un-stash your work.

Merging branches combines the files of the two into one branch.

Sometimes there will be a merge conflict where the changes between the files are in direct conflict.
A merge conflict is inevitable at some point in your career, but you should be mindful about it. On some large enterprise applications, a merge conflict can create significant issues, but it will be easier to face a possible conflict if you are comfortable with it.
