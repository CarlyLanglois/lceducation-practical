Merging in Git
==============

Stash and un-stash changes making up partially-completed work

Before you commit something, you may have realized that there is some work that you never pulled down. That is a time to stash your work so that you can pull in any necessary changes and then un-stash your work.

Merge one branch into another

Merging branches combines the files of the two into one branch.

Describe what happens when, during a merge, there are conflicting changes in the two branches

Sometimes there will be a merge conflict where the changes between the files have to be decided on.
A merge conflict is inevitable at some point in your career, but you should be mindful about it. On some large enterprise applications, a merge conflict can create significant issues, but it will be easier to face a possible conflict if you are comfortable with it.
