Chapter 4 Exercises
===================

These exercises will check your understanding of the topics in this chapter. Practice 

For the following exercises, you will use the information given below about your space shuttle.

.. note::

   When the term **print** is used, that means to output a value to the ``console`` 
   using ``console.log("text or a variable name")``.  
   
   | Print ``"hello"`` means ``console.log("hello")``

.. list-table:: Space Shuttle Information
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Data
     - Value
   * - Name of the space shuttle
     - Determination
   * - Shuttle Speed (mph)
     - 17,500
   * - Distance to Mars (km)
     - 225,000,000
   * - Distance to the Moon (km)
     - 384,400
   * - Miles per kilometer
     - 0.621

Declare and assign a variables
------------------------------
For each row in the table above declare and assign variables.

Print out the type of each variable
-----------------------------------
For each variable you declared in the previous section, use the ``typeof`` operator to print it's type

Now let's calculate a space mission!
------------------------------------
We need to determine how many days it will take to reach Mars.

a. Create and assign a Miles to Mars variable

   * Miles per kilometer * Distance to Mars

b. Next, we need a variable to hold the hours it would take to get to Mars

   * Miles to Mars / Shuttle Speed

c. Finally, declare a variable and assign it the value of days to Mars

   * Hours To Mars / 24

Print out the results of your calculations
------------------------------------------
Using your result from the previous section, print to the screen a sentence that says ``"Determination will take ___ days to reach Mars."``

Now calculate a trip to the Moon
--------------------------------
Repeat the calculations but this time determine the number of days it would take to travel to the Moon.
