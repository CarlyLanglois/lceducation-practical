CSS Rules
=========

.. index:: ! rules

Programmers can change a lot of different styling using CSS **rules**. A rule includes the selector and a declaration block.
Inside the declaration block, programmers set CSS properties to specific values. CSS has a lot of different properties and it would be impossible to memorize them all.

Below are some examples of common CSS properties and what they do. It is by no means an exhaustive list of all of the possibilities in CSS, but it is a good place to start.

font-size: changes the size of the font.
color: changes the color.
font-family: changes the font types.
background-color: sets the color of the background of an element.
text-align: aligns the text within an element.

Each CSS property has a default value, so it is unnecessary to declare and initialize everything, just change what needs to be changed.

HTML elements also default to how it displays on the page. Inline elements do not start a new line and block display does.
