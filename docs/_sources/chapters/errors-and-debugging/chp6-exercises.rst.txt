Chapter 6 Exercises (Debugging)
===============================

Avast, ye scurvy dogs!  We be needn’ ta fix yonder code!

The cap’n in charge of clearing the shuttle for launch(code) be out with
an illness, and ye be the next tech in line.

Yer job is to evaluate the code and fix any errors.  Remember, the lives
of the crew rest squarely upon yer shoulders.  Happy second day on the job!

ParametARRRs
------------
#. Launch the shuttle ONLY IF the fuel, crew and computer all check out OK.
#. If a check fails, print that information to the console and scrub the
    launch (then scrub the deck).
#. If all checks be successful, print a countdown to the console, then
    bellow “Liftoff!”

Debugging practice
------------------
#. Fix **syntax errors** first.  Run the following code as-is and squint
    yer eyes at the error message.  Fix the mistake, and then re-run the
    code to check it.

..sourcecode:: (javascript)

    let launchReady = false;
    let fuelLevel = 17000;

    if (fuelLevel >= 20000 {
    console.log('Fuel level cleared.');
    launchReady = true;
    } else {
    console.log('WARNING: Insufficient fuel!');
    launchReady = false;
    }
