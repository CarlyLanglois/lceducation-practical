HTML Structure

Describe HTML document structure and associated elements: doctype, <html>, <head>, <body>, <title>

Before programmers can get started with tags, they must first set up the proper structure. Every HTML file needs a ``doctype`` tag, specifying that the file is in fact, HTML.
The ``<html>`` tag denotes the beginning and end of the HTML the programmer has written. This tag may seem unnecessary if the file only contains HTML, but as you incorporate JavaScript into your HTML, the ``<html>`` tag will become more and more important.
The ``<head>`` tag holds everything that goes at the head of the document.
The ``<body>`` tag holds everything that appears on the page of the document. 
The ``<title>`` tag goes in the ``<head>`` of the document and is required. It gives the title of the webpage.

Write a properly-structured document head.
Every document head needs to include the title of the document. It may also include links to other files.

Write HTML comments
Just like when writing JavaScript, a programmer may find themselves wanting to leave comments for their fellow programmers.
In order to write a comment in HTML, programmers start their comment with ``<!--`` and end their comment with ``-->``.
