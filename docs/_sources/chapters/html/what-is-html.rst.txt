Know what HTML stands for

HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language. Javascript and HTML are both coding languages, but HTML is actually a markup language. The difference between a markup language and a programming language may seem insignificant, but sometimes knowing the difference can help one understand HTML better!
Markup languages use tags to define the elements within a page. When markup languages are interpreted, the document is constructed by the tags the programmer has put in.

Describe the components of HTML tag structure

A tag in HTML is comprised of <> brackets, the tag type, and must have a corresponding closing tag. Tags can also include class info for the tag if it is all in one section and other tag info.

Describe what an HTML element is, and how an element is related to a tag

An HTML element is a section of the page, whether it be a paragraph or header. The type of element is denoted inside the tag.
