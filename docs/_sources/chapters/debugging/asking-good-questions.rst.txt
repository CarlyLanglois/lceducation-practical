Asking Good Questions
=====================

If employing the strategies outlined in this chapter still don't help you find a bug in your code, you always have other programmers to reach out to.

Whether you are asking a question of your teaching assistant, another student, or a stranger in an online forum, you should be able to answer these 3 questions discussed in this section.

Not only will these questions help others assist you more directly, but they also may lead you to the answer yourself! 

What is the problem with your code?
-----------------------------------

You should be able to state in general terms what the error that you are experiencing is. 

**Bad:** "My program is broken."

**Bad:** "I'm getting this error."

**Good:** "There is a ReferenceError on line 23, but it's not clear to me what's causing it."

What have you done to try to address the problem?
-------------------------------------------------

Another programmer can glean a lot of information from understanding what you have already tried. 

**Bad:** Asking for help immediately.

**Bad:** Using trial and error without any specific direction.

**Good:** "I added user input validation, but am still seeing the problem."

Where have you looked for an answer?
------------------------------------

**Bad:** "I haven't looked online at all."

**Bad:** "I Googled 'js range error' and didn't see anything."

**Good:** "I Googled 'js range error boolean expression' and found a question on Stack Overflow that seemed relevant. I tried the the recommended solution, but it didn't fix my problem."
