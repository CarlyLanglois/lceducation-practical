What is Debugging?
==================

.. index:: ! debugging, ! bug

Programming is a complex process. Since it is done by human beings, errors often occur. Programming errors are called **bugs** and the process of tracking them down and correcting them is called **debugging**.  

Some claim that in 1945, a dead moth caused a problem on relay number 70, panel F, of one of the first computers at Harvard, and the term bug has remained in use since. Wikipedia even has an image of the supposed `first bug <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:H96566k.jpg>`_.

Three kinds of errors can occur in a program: `syntax errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_error>`_, `runtime errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runtime_error>`_, and `logic errors <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_error>`_. We will learn about each type of error before discussing strategies for debugging code and reducing errors.

Beginning Tips for Debugging
----------------------------

.. todo:: edit this section

Debugging a program is a different way of thinking than writing a program. The process of debugging is much more like being a detective. Here are a few rules to get you thinking about debugging.

#. Everyone is a suspect (except Python)!  It's common for beginner programmers to blame Python, but that should be your last resort. Remember that Python has been used to solve CS1 level problems millions of times by millions of other programmers. So, Python is probably not the problem.

#. Find clues. This is the biggest job of the detective and right now there are two important tools for finding clues that you can use.

   * Error Messages

   * Print Statements
