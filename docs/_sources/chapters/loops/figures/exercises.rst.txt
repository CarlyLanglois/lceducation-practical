``for`` Practice
-----------------

#. Construct ``for`` loops that accomplish the following tasks:
    a. Print the numbers 0 - 20, one number per line.
    b. Print only the ODD values from 3 - 29, one number per line.
    c. Print the EVEN numbers 12 to -14 in descending order, one number per
        line.
    d. **Challenge** - Print the numbers 50 - 20 in descending order, but only
        if the numbers are multiples of 3.  (Your code should work even if
        you replace 50 or 20 with other numbers).

#. Initialize two variables to hold the string “LaunchCode” and the array [1, 5, ‘LC101’, ‘blue’, 42],
then construct ``for`` loops to accomplish the following tasks:
    a. Print each element of the array to a new line,
    b. Print each character of the string - in reverse order - to a new line,

#. Construct a ``for`` loop that sorts the array [2, 3, 13, 18, -5, 38, -10, 11, 0, 104]
into two new arrays - one that contains the even numbers, and the other that
holds the odds.  Print the arrays to confirm the results.
