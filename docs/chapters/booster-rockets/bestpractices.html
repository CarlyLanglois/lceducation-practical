<h1>6.1. Best Practices: Learning To Code<a class="headerlink" href="#best-practices-learning-to-code" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>For years, the education community has debated the best approach for
<em>‘homework’</em>.  Should it be scored or not?  What is the proper amount?  Should
it be even be used?  “Studies have shown…”</p>
<p>We cannot possibly restate all the conclusions here, nor will we present any
part of the debates.  Instead, here are a few simple facts for LC101:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Yes, there is homework.  This consists of prep work, exercises, studios
and assignments.</li>
<li>Only the assignments earn a “score”.</li>
<li>You do not have to do the ungraded homework, but you absolutely <strong>SHOULD</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The rest of this page is our attempt to motivate you to complete ALL of the
work for LC101.  How much encouragement you need depends on your personality.
Feel free to read the sections that most appeal to your psyche and are likely
to encourage you.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>“Thanks, LaunchCode, but you convinced me at, ‘Do all the homework.’ ”</div></blockquote>
<p>If this is your thinking, then bless you.  Skip to the best practices listed
in the last section.  You’re awesome!</p>
<p>Otherwise, on to the motivational attempts…</p>

<p>Experience is definitely the best teacher.  You could read pages and pages
about <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">for</span></code> loops, which will give you a handle on the vocabulary, but until
you actually construct your first working loop, your understanding will be
incomplete.</p>

<blockquote>
<div>“When I stumble, I <em>WILL</em> pick myself up, brush off the dust, and try
again.”</div></blockquote>
<p>All throughout LC101, you will be asked to code.  Each exercise, studio and
assignment is designed to give you experience through practice.  You WILL make
mistakes, and that is OK.  Often, our mistakes teach us more than getting the
“correct answer” on our first try.</p>
<p>Every genius programmer you see on YouTube started out in front of a screen
saying, “Oops,” “ARGH!” or “#*&amp;%%&#64;#!”  No one simply “gets” coding without some
trial-and-error.</p>

<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Let’s take a look at a sample coding task:</dt>
<dd>“Prompt the user to enter a number, then print ‘Even’ if it is divisible
by 2, otherwise print ‘Odd’.”</dd>
</dl>
<p>Now let’s take a look at an imaginary student’s attempt:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="mf">1.</span> <span class="c1">//Prompt the user to enter a number.</span>
<span class="mf">2.</span> <span class="c1">//Print ‘Even’ if it is divisible by 2, otherwise print ‘Odd’.</span>
<span class="mf">3.</span>
<span class="mf">4.</span>
<span class="mf">5.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>Hmmm.  A blank answer space.  What might be the reason?</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last loweralpha simple">
<li>The student did not understand how to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The student knew how to solve the problem so decided to skip the task.</li>
<li>The student tried to solve the problem, could not get the program to work,
so deleted the code.</li>
<li>The student ran out of time when trying to complete the prep work before
class.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>From a teacher’s perspective, ANY of these reasons could be valid, and we have
no way of determining which is true.  This prevents us from knowing where to
begin to best help the student.</p>
<p>For the student, a blank response provides no benefit because the necessary
practice was either ignored or incomplete.  Students gain only as much as they
put in. So:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Even if you have no clue how to approach a task, MAKE AN ATTEMPT ANYWAY,
then ask questions.</li>
<li>If you know how to solve the problem, COMPLETE THE TASK ANYWAY, because
practice makes better.  Also, you could use your code to help answer a
classmate’s question.</li>
<li>If you tried to solve the problem, but your code did not work, DO NOT DELETE
YOUR ATTEMPT.  Ask a question.  Showing your work to your teacher, TA or
classmates will give them a clear idea about your thought process.</li>
<li>If you ran out of time, GO BACK AND FILL IN THE BLANKS LATER.  Practice
makes better.  If you neglect one set of skills, then the tasks that come
later and depend on those skills will be more difficult.</li>
</ol>
<p>Take-home lesson: You need the practice.  <strong>Do your homework</strong>.</p>

<p>Baseball: “There may be people who have more talent than you, but there’s
no excuse for anyone to work harder than you do.” - <em>Derek Jeter</em></p>

I didn’t take at all.”</strong> - <em>Simone Biles</em></p>
<p>Football: “I was always willing to work.  I was not the fastest or biggest
player, but I was determined to be the best football player I could be on the
football field, and I think I was able to accomplish that through hard work.” -

<dt><em>Whew!</em>  You made it to the bottom of the page.  Good job.  Here are some final bits of advice:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>DO try every exercise, studio and practice problem.</li>
<li>Repeated practice helps cement the basic syntax quirks for a given programming language.</li>
<li>DO experiment.  Once your code correctly solves the given task, feel free to tweak it.  Great fun can be had if you ask, “What if I try ____,” and then go and do just that.  For example, if the problem asked you to sort a list alphabetically, could you order it from z to a instead?</li>
<li>ASK for help when you get stuck.  We’ve all been there, and there is no shame in seeking advice.  Use your instructors, TA’s, classmates and Google as the brilliant resources they are.</li>
<li>The only ‘dumb questions’ are the ones that are not asked.</li>
<li>The rubber duck method works.  Sometimes just describing a coding problem out loud (to your screen, a co-worker or a rubber duck) sparks an idea about how to solve it.</li>
<li>DO NOT copy/paste answers.  There are plenty of websites where you can find complete code posted.  A simple copy/paste into the assignment box will give you a correct result, but you have completely skipped your learning opportunity.</li>
