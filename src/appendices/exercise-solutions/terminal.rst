3. Use ``ls`` to view the contents of your Home directory.

   ::

      My-Computer:~ myusername$ ls

   ::

      My-Computer:Desktop myusername$ mkdir my_first_directory

7. ``pwd`` to check your location.

   ::

      My-Computer:my_first_directory myusername$ pwd

11. Make a copy of your 'my_first_file.txt' from it's current spot to directly on the Desktop with ``cp my_first_file.txt ../my_first_copy.txt``.

   ::

      My-Computer:my_first_directory myusername$ cp my_first_file.txt ../my_first_copy.txt

13. Use ``ls`` in the terminal to verify your 'my_first_copy.txt' on your Desktop. Open it up. Is it the same as your first file?

   ::

      My-Computer:Desktop myusername$ ls

15. Use ``ls`` to see that the copied file is no longer on your Desktop.

   ::

      My-Computer:Desktop myusername$ ls

17. ``cd ..`` to get back out to your Desktop.

   ::

      My-Computer:my_first_directory myusername$ cd ..
