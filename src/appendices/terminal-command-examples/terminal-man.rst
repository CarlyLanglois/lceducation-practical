``man`` Command
===============

``man`` is your best friend. Running ``man <command>`` gives you a manual
entry of what that command does, what options it takes, and more
documentation than you could ever need. It's so thorough, it makes this
guide blush. Any command you think you may need but you're not sure how 
to use it, or maybe you want to do something specific and are wondering if
there's a specialized option for it, use ``man`` to get more info!

Practice looking up some of the commands you know; maybe you'll learn a 
new option or two!

Some other terminal stuff you should know when using the manual:

- Some entries are very long! They will probably need to be scrolled
through. You'll know there's more to read if you see ``:`` at the bottom
of your terminal window. You can use your keyboard's arrow keys to
navigate the entry. If you reach the bottom of the entry,
you'll see a line that reads ``END``.

- Once you're finished reading, you'll need to exit the manual page using
the :ref:`terminal-q` command.
