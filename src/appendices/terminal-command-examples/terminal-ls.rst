    Sample file tree


Imagine you are inside of this file system. Starting at the top directory,
*launchcode_courses*, entering the ``ls`` command in your terminal 
returns the contents of your current directory.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   $ ls
   data_analysis   lc_101

Moving into *data_analysis*, entering the ``ls`` command returns the 
following:

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   $ ls
   cities.sql      final_project   lakes.json
