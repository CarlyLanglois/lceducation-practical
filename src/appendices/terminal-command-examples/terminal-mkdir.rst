``mkdir`` Command
=================

    Sample file tree


``mkdir <new_directory_name>`` creates a new directory at your current 
location. 

Let's start in the *lc_101* directory and create a directory for Unit 2
materials.

.. sourcecode:: bash
   :linenos:

   $ mkdir unit_2
   $ 

The computer does not return anything to you after this command and 
simply responds ready to accept another prompt. 
But we can visualize the results:

.. figure:: ./figures/mkdir.png
    :alt: Sample file tree with a new directory

    mkdir creates a new directory
