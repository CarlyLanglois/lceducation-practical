Terminal Basics Tutorial
========================

As mentioned in the terminal chapter, the essence of the command line is 
is text. Since this is quite different from how many may be used to using
their computers, this tutorial is meant to help you picture how your
machine is responding when you input common commands into the terminal.

Your computer is basically a file storage system. Sure, you may have many
applications installed. But where do they all live? In folders. Aka,
directories. The basics of terminal usage involve navigating these
directories.

Let's take this sample file system below:

.. figure:: ./figures/initial.png
    :alt: Sample file tree

    Sample file tree


It can be helpful to consider the image above as a map and you are an
explorer inside of it. 


Imagine you are inside of this file system. ``.`` is a reference 
to your current directory.

Starting at the top directory, *launchcode_courses*, ``.`` represents 
your current location.

If you move into *lc_101*, ``.`` then refers to that directory.
