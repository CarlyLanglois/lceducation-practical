``clear`` Command
=================

``clear`` wipes your terminal window of any previously run commands 
and outputs in case you need a clean screen to think straight. 

You probably won't encounter a scenario where you NEED to clear your
terminal, but it can be a nice command to know if you're a minimalist.
