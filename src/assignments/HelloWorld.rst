Assignment #0: Hello World
==========================

Your first assignment is mostly an exercise in following instructions. We'll ask you to modify
an existing program so that, when run, the program prints "Hello, World!". Sound simple?

Programming jobs often require you to get familiar with, or at least make 
use of, additional technologies. Here, you'll be using a few web applications, like GitHub and repl.it, 
to write your code, run it, save it, and submit your assignment.

So while the coding task may appear straightforward, you'll be introduced to a set of instructions, 
or **workflow**, that is important for the rest of your success in this class.

	Read this whole page before you start taking any action.

Requirements
------------

#. Sign up for a GitHub account.
#. Sign up for a repl.it account.
#. Open and accept the GitHub classroom assignment invitation.
#. Change the code in repl.it.
#. Commit the code in repl.it.
#. Make sure your assignment passes the test.

GitHub
~~~~~~

If you haven't done so already, create a 
`GitHub account <https://github.com/join?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2F&source=header-home>`__.

repl.it
~~~~~~~

If you haven't already done so, create a 
`repl.it account <https://repl.it/signup>`__.


Assignment Invitation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In your Canvas classroom, click on the Assignment 0 link to accept your invitation to start coding 
your assignment solution.

.. admonition:: Note

	The first time you do this, ie for this assignment, you will need to authorize your repl.it account to
	work with your GitHub account. 

Hello, World!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have accepted the assignment, you will need to modify the code to print ``Hello, World!"``. 
When you run the code to begin with, the program prints just ``"Hello"``. 

Take a look at the ``index.js`` file. This is the only file in your starter code that needs changing.
You'll see a structure called a ``function``, along with some other code, that we haven't started learning yet.
Have a look around and get curious about what this code does. Indeed, open some of the other files and look around.
Don't be afraid to look - just don't edit any of this code except for this string. 
However, you'll also see a string. You don't need to change anything else except for this string. In fact, 
changing anything else may cause your program not to run properly. So only change the string.

Commit Your Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now that your program prints ``Hello, World!"``, you'll commit your code. Committing your code is part of 
a process called version control, which we'll get into in a later lesson. For now, go to the sidebar in your repl.it
window and click on the Git icon. 
Write a commit message indicating the change you made to the starter code to make your own solution code.
Hit the commit button. Voila - your solution is submitted to the GitHub gods.

Check Your Solution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you've committed your work, head to the Github repository to see that your solution passes the tests.
If it passes, you will see a green check mark near your latest commit.
If your solution does not pass, you will see a red ``x`` in its place.
A red ``x`` can always be corrected by repeating the previous two steps - open repl.it, change the string, run the 
program to visually ensure that ``"Hello, world!"`` is printed, commit your changes.
You may make any number of commits to your solution. You won't lose points for trying multiple commits - in fact, each
assignment is worth only 1 point.
In most cases, you won't need to however, since you can verify that your code runs as we expect by running it 
and seeing the proper message printed.
