Strategic Debugging
===================

Summary
-------

At this point, we have seen a lot of different types of errors.
We have possibly created logic errors or syntax errors and now, we have just learned about the ``Error`` object in JavaScript.
The goal of this studio is for us to develop strategies for debugging so that we can get rid of the bugs and get back to coding!

Activity
--------

Think of a bug you have seen in your code.
This could be the time you dropped a keyword when initializing a variable or misused a method.

1. Take some time to discuss with the group what your error was and how you solved it.
   Did you talk to a TA to get it?
   Did you find a great resource online that was helpful?

Your TA will go over the pros and cons of different resources that can help you resolve the error.
You will then go over a general strategy to start debugging your errors.
