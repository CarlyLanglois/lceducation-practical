What is HTML?
=============

.. index:: ! tag, ! element


With coding languages, there is a family of languages called **markup languages**. Markup languages are used to annotate the text of a document and define the structure.
Hyper Text Markup Language (or HTML) is a coding language used to define the structure of a web page.

When it comes to writing HTML, there are two main components of the web page that one should consider: elements and tags.

HTML Elements
-------------

An HTML **element** is a section of the page. HTML elements can be anything from the text, subtitles and titles on the page to the small footers and name of the web page that appears on the tabs.

HTML tags
---------

A HTML **tag** is the code that the computer processes to determine the type and content of an HTML element.

Each tag has the following structural elements:

1. ``<`` to start a tag and ``>`` to close it.
2. The type of tag it is.
3. Any additional information needed about the element that the tag is about.

Just as important as letting the computer know when an HTML element starts is letting it know when the element ends. Closing tags include the same information as the opening tag with a ``\`` before the ``>`` bracket.

Just as there are different ways to write Javascript, there are different ways to write HTML. Semantic HTML helps programmers communicate through code and may be easier to pick up at first.
Semantic HTML is not just about the appearance of the web page, but also the specific meaning. Programmers can make a paragraph larger than a page title, however, by looking at the HTML another programmer can understand which is the paragraph and which is the page title.
Making code work is important and so is making it easier for other programmers to read. Not every piece of a code a programmer has read is something they have written.
Another benefit to semantic HTML is that it is easier for beginning programmers to visualize the end results. Some examples of semantic HTML tags are: ``<p>``, ``<h1>``, ``<h2>`` , and ``<div>``.
