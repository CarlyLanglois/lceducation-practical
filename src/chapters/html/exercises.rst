.. replit:: html
   :slug: HTMLExercises
   :linenos:

   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
      <head>
         <!-- title goes here --->
      </head>
      <body>
         <!-- h1 goes here --->
         <!-- ol goes here --->
         <!-- a goes here --->
         <!-- p goes here --->
      </body>
   </html>

   repl.it has other HTML inside of the ``index.html`` file you will be editing. You should not be deleting any code only, only adding code to the file!
