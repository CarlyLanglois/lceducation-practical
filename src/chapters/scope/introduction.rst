Introduction
============

Scoping is important. You can access variables depending on their scope. If you access a variable outside of the scope, it throws an error called a scope error.

Block/Local Scope
-----------------
Local scope refers to variables declared and initialized inside a function.
Those variables can only be referenced inside of the block.

Global Scope
------------

Global scope refers to variables declared and initialized outside of a function and in the main body of the file.
These variables are accessible by any function within a file.

Execution Context
-----------------

Execution context refers to how the scoping of the variables effects the execution of the code.
