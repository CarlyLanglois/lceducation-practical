About LaunchCode Programs
=========================

Goals
=====

Our programs are focused on building our problem solving skills and learning how to learn.
Technology is ever-changing and we want you to be able to adapt to fit the needs of the industry.

LaunchCode is a nonprofit focused on providing people the resources they need to get jobs in technology.
This includes our free education programs. The curriculum in our programs is focused on preparing our students for jobs.
We won't teach you technologies that you do NOT need to know to get a job.

Blended learning
================

A blended learning model incorporates in- and out-of-class learning.
We only have a short amount of time in class to learn a lot, so using a blended learning model helps us make the most of our time in LC101.
