Why Learn To Code?
==================

How many times do you use a computer in a day?
We use computers to check emails and social media, to watch TV, and to even set an alarm for the next day.
Computers and technology are becoming ever prevalent in our society. 

With the rise of technology and computers, coding has risen as well.
At its most basic level, coding is how humans communicate with computers.
With code, humans can ask the computer to complete specific tasks and store specific information.
Many would argue that because of the prevalence of computers, that learning to code is vital to living in the 21st century.
Writing and reading code is becoming a new form of literacy for today's world.

As our needs change, technology changes to meet them.
When we needed a way to talk to each other, we got phones.
As our needs to communicate changed, our phones became portable.
Then, we gained the ability to use our phones to send quick written messages to each other.
A career as a technologist, specifically as a programmer, is one of lifelong learning.
