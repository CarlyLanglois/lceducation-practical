Using This Book
===============

Throughout this book, you will find a variety of different sections and practice exercises.
We are writing this guide to help you make the most of the book.

Concept checks
--------------

Many sections end with a "Check Your Understanding".
This section is full of questions for you to double check that you understand the concepts in the reading.
Your score does not count towards your final grade in the class
You should be using your score for self-evaluation on concepts you may need help with in-class.

Examples
--------

Examples are times when we tie a concept we have just learned to a potential real world application of the concept.

Oftentimes, an example is called a "Try It". These are examples with code you can modify, augment, and play around with.
"Try It" examples are ways for you to quickly reinforce what you have just read.

JS in Context
-------------

Our approach is different from other ways you can learn JavaScript.
The book focuses on programming fundamentals.
These fundamentals are problem-solving and transferable concepts.
While we will cover the exact way to perform certain tasks in JavaScript, we want to remind you that these tasks are relatively common and many programming languages have ways to carry them out.
