About LaunchCode Programs
=========================

Goals
-----

We want our programs to help you build your problem solving skills and
encourage you to learn how to learn. Whether you use the coding skills you gain
in this program to get a job as a developer is up to you. However, no matter
the path you take after this program, learning how to learn will help you
continually adapt to the changing needs of your industry.

To get you ready for a career in technology, our goal is to teach you the
skills found in a wide variety of industries.


Course Activities
-----------------

We have spent a lot of time creating the course activities to make the most of
your in-class and out-of-class time. While there are a lot of different
activities we will do in a day, it is important to actively engage with each
activity. Skipping the prep work or falling behind on assignments can quickly
lead to struggling to complete the course.

Textbook Reading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Think of this textbook as your first destination in your learning journey. 
In addition to reading, this text includes small questions that can help you 
reinforce your understanding of the new material. Reviewing your notes from 
a given chapter before moving on to the next is another great way to make the 
most of your learning potential.

Exercises
^^^^^^^^^

At the end of most of the textbook chapters, you will find a a page called "Exercises".
Exercises are small coding problems and are a chance for you to implement what
you have just learned. While exercises do not count towards your final grade in
the class, it is essential to practice in order to reinforce your understanding
of the new concepts.


Assignments
^^^^^^^^^^^

Assignments are larger projects where you demonstrate what you have learned and
challenge yourself. Assignments oftentimes cover multiple lessons.
