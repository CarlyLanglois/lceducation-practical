About LaunchCode Programs
=========================

Goals
=====

The goal of our programs is to build our problem solving skills and to learn how to learn.
Whether you use the coding skills you learn in this program to get a job as a developer is up to you.
No matter the path you take after this program, learning how to learn will help you continually adapt to the changing needs of your industry.

A goal for us is that we teach you skills to prepare you for jobs in technology.
We are here to teach you technologies that are prevalent throughout a wide variety of industries.

Blended learning
================

.. index:: ! blended learning model

We only have a short amount of time in class to learn a lot, so using a **blended learning model** helps us make the most of our time in this class.
A blended learning model incorporates in-class learning with online materials such as this textbook.

Course activities
=================

We have spent a lot of time creating the course activities to make the most of your in-class and out-of-class time.
While there are a lot of different activities we will do in a day, it is important to actively engage with each activity.
Skipping the prep work or falling behind on assignments can quickly lead to struggling in the class.

**Include a step diagram, noting that skipping any of the components creates a larger gap to cross**

Prep Work
---------

Prep Work is done before each class session and covers the topics that you will learn about that day. 
In addition to reading, prep work includes small questions that can help you reinforce your understanding of what you have just read.
We have found that covering the material for the day before class helps students make the most of their short in-class time.

Exercises
---------

Exercises are small coding problems that are a chance for you to implement what you have just learned.
While exercises do not count towards your final grade in the class, you will find it essential to practice coding concepts in a low pressure way.

In-class Time
-------------

Large Group Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During the large group time, the whole class will listen to lecture and take time for Q&A.
This is a time for us to review examples as a group and shore up concepts from the prep work.

Small Group Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

After the large group time, we will break up into small groups. During small group time, we will do in-class coding activities called studios.
This time is equally as important as large group time because it is time for individual support and a place where you can feel comfortable talking openly about concepts you are struggling with.


Assignments
-----------

Assignments are larger projects where you can demonstrating what you have learned and challenge yourself.
Assignments oftentimes will cover multiple lessons.
