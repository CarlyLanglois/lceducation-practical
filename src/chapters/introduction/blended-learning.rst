Blended Learning
================

.. index:: ! blended learning model

We only have a short amount of time in class to learn a lot, so using a
**blended learning model** helps us make the most of our time in this course. A
blended learning model incorporates in-class learning with online materials
such as this textbook.

Course Activities
-----------------

We have spent a lot of time creating the course activities to make the most of
your in-class and out-of-class time. While there are a lot of different
activities we will do in a day, it is important to actively engage with each
activity. Skipping the prep work or falling behind on assignments can quickly
lead to struggling to complete the course.

In-Class Time
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In class, you will meet many fellow students on the same learning journey as
you. We encourage students to engage, interact, and encourage each other
throughout the class.

In class there will also be an instructor and teaching assistants. This
dedicated staff facilitates the activities and provides support to the
students.

Large Group Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

During the large group time, the whole class participates in the lesson, led by
the instructor. The lesson is not a substitute for doing the prep work before
class. It's a time for us to review examples as a group and shore up concepts
from the prep work.

Small Group Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After the large group time, we will break up into small groups, each led by a
teaching assistant. During small group time, we will do in-class coding
activities called studios. This time is equally as important as large group
time because it is time for individual support and a place where you can feel
comfortable talking openly about concepts you are struggling with.
