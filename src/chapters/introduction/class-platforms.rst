Class Platforms
===============
Beyond this book, this class uses additional platforms for enrollment, assignments, and grading.

Canvas
======

LaunchCode monitors your progress in this class through a management system
called *Canvas*. It provides a central location to manage the flow of
information, but it does not hold the actual course content. Instead, it links
to the lessons you need, and it keeps a record of your completed assignments
and scores.

Login to Canvas
---------------
Access canvas and the course assignments at `<https://learn.launchcode.org/>`_.
To login use your launchcode.org username and password. That is the same username
and password that you used to apply for this class.

Canvas Dashboard
----------------
After logging in, you will arrive at your *dashboard*, which displays the
LaunchCode courses you can access, upcoming due dates, and several menu items.

Clicking on a course title takes you to that class' homepage, which shows
upcoming due dates, announcements, general information, and menu options. You
will probably use the *Syllabus* and *Assignments* options the most often.

Syllabus Page
--------------

The syllabus page provides general information such as a description of the
class, the timeline for the course, a calendar, and a To Do list. Scrolling
down on the page shows the "Course Summary", which holds links to individual
tasks (reading, quizzes, assignments, etc.).

This page is a good place to answer the questions *What do I need to do next*,
and *How can I quickly find and review an old topic*.

Assignments Page
-----------------

This page sorts required tasks by date or type. A few days before each class
session, new tasks will appear on the list. Old content remains active,
allowing you to use the links for reference and review.

Clicking on a specific title brings up information about that task, including
the due date, points possible, instructions, and links.

Even though much of the course content can be accessed without logging in, the
best choice is to begin from within Canvas. That way your progress gets
recorded, and your scores will update smoothly as you complete quizzes. Also,
submitting files for the larger assignments should only be done through Canvas.

.. _replit-classroom:

Repl.it
=======
`Repl.it <https://repl.it>`_ is an online code editor. For this class repl.it will serve two purposes.

Repl.it Account Creation
------------------------
Creating a repl.it account is covered in :ref:`Chapter 2 <create-replit-account>`. Students will register
for the repl.it Classroom as part of an assignment in canvas.

Standard Repl.it
----------------
Standard repl.it is an online code editor for various languages. Coders collaborate by sharing repl.it URLs.

Standard repl.it is used for:

* Publicly sharing code examples and starter code
* A place to practice new concepts by writing and running code

Repl.it Classroom
-----------------
Repl.it **Classroom** provides classroom features along with online code editing and submission. Repl.it Classroom allows
code assignments and grades to be kept private from people that are not in the class.

Repl.it Classroom is used for:

* Completing then submitting exercises and getting feedback
* Completing then submitting studios and assignments for a grade
* Keeping student submissions visible to ONLY teachers in the repl.it classroom

.. tip::

   You **never** have to click save when using standard repl.it or repl.it classroom. Repl.it automatically saves your code on their servers.
   Keep in mind that when using repl.it classroom you do have to click submit to submit your work.
