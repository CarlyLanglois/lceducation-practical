#. Assign a variable named spaceShuttleName the value of Determination.
#. Which type are each of the variables listed below?
    
   .. sourcecode:: js

      let orbitSpeedMilesPerHour = 17500;
      let orbitSpeedString = “17,500”;
      let gForcesAtLaunch  = “3G”;
      let readyForLaunch = “yes”;
      let earthToMarsKilometers = 225000000;
      let earthToMoonKilometers = 384400;

#. Time to calculate some important values for our space shuttle!

   #. How long will it take to reach Mars?
   #. How long does it take to reach the moon?
   #. Using the values above, print to the screen a sentence for your fellow rocket scientists about the amount of time it will take for Determination to reach Mars and how long it will take for Determination to reach the moon.
