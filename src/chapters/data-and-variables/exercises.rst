Exercises: Data and Variables
=============================

Exercises appear regularly in the book. Just like the concept checks, these
exercises will check your understanding of the topics in this chapter. They
also provide good practice for the new skills.

Unlike the concept checks, you will need a code editor to complete the
exercises. Fortunately, you :ref:`created a free account <hello-world>` on
Repl.it as part of the prep work.

`Open this link <https://repl.it/@launchcode/Exercises-Data-and-Variables>`__
to the repl.it file prepared for this task, then follow the instructions below.

Practice
---------

Use the information given below about your space shuttle to complete the
exercises:

.. list-table::
   :widths: auto
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Data
     - Value
   * - Name of the space shuttle
     - Determination
   * - Shuttle Speed (mph)
     - 17,500
   * - Distance to Mars (km)
     - 225,000,000
   * - Distance to the Moon (km)
     - 384,400
   * - Miles per kilometer
     - 0.621

#. **Declare and assign variables**

   For each row in the table above, declare and assign variables.

   *Hint*: When declaring and assigning your variables, remember that you will
   need to use that variable throughout the rest of the exercises. Make sure
   that you are using the correct data type!

#. **Print out the type of each variable**

   For each variable you declared in the previous section, use the ``typeof``
   operator to print its type to the console.

#. **Calculate a space mission!**

   We need to determine how many days it will take to reach Mars.

   #. Create and assign a miles to Mars variable. You can get the miles to Mars
      by multiplying the distance to Mars in kilometers by the miles per
      kilometer.
   #. Next, we need a variable to hold the hours it would take to get to Mars.
      To get the hours, you need to divide the distance to Mars in miles by the
      shuttle's speed.
   #. Finally, declare a variable and assign it the value of days to Mars. In
      order to get the days it will take to reach Mars, you need to divide the
      hours it will take to reach Mars by 24.

#. **Print out the results of your calculations**

     Using the variable from part 3c above, print to the screen a sentence that
     says ``"_____ will take ___ days to reach Mars."``

   Fill in the blanks with the shuttle name and the calculated time.

#. **Now calculate a trip to the Moon**

   Repeat the calculations, but this time determine the number of days it would
   take to travel to the Moon and print to the screen a sentence that says
   ``"_____ will take ___ days to reach the Moon."``.
