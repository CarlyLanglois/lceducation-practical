Angular First Steps
====================

The goal here is to create a minimum working webpage template. It will serve as
a jumping off point for your later exercises and studios, so be sure you are
logged into your GitHub account.

Starting a New Project
-----------------------

Navigate to the `StackBlitz homepage <https://stackblitz.com>`__. Click "Start
New App", then select the "Angular (TypeScript)" option.

   TODO: Add screenshot of homepage selections.

Examine the files created:

   TODO: Add screenshot of file tree.

#. The ``src`` folder holds all the files needed to make the template function.
#. The ``app`` folder holds the instructions for displaying the smaller pieces
   of a webpage. We will modify these files soon.
#. ``index.html`` is the highest level for displaying content. Anything added
   to this page will appear on every page within a website.
#. ``main.ts`` imports the core methods required to make everything work. It
   also  imports the ``app`` modules, which control the appearance of a
   webpage.
#. ``styles.css`` holds the global style settings for the entire website.

Experiment & Learn
-------------------

Go ahead and close the preview panel, then click the button to open the preview
in a new browser window. You will see some simple content.

Let's play around a little bit as we learn about the different project files.

Inside the ``app`` folder

Open the ``app.component.html`` and examine its content.
