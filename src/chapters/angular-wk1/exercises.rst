Exercises: Angular, Lesson 1
=============================

Starter Code
-------------

For this set of exercises, fork this StackBlitz project [LINK].
``hello.component.ts`` has already been removed, and two other components have
been added.

Open the preview in a new window and examine the content of the webpage.

Part 1: Modify the CSS
-----------------------

The ``movies`` and ``chores`` components have been created, but so far they
appear pretty bland. Let's change that.

#. Change the movie list text by adjusting the code in ``movies.component.css``
   to accomplish the following:

   #. The text can be any color EXCEPT black.
   #. The movie list should have a centered heading.
   #. There should be at least 4 movie titles in an ordered list.
   #. The font size should be large enough to easily read.

#. Change the chore list text by adjusting the code in ``chores.component.css``
   to accomplish the following:

   #. The text color should be different from the movie list, and not black.
   #. The chores list should have an underlined heading.
   #. The chores in the list should be italicized.
   #. The font size should be large enough to easily read.

Part 2: Add Two More Components
---------------------------------

3. Lorem ipsum...

#. Lorem ipsum...

Part 3: Rearrange the Components
---------------------------------

Part 4: Final Touches
-----------------------

6. Complete one or more of the following:

   #. Change the background to a decent color, image or pattern.
   #. Add a border around 1 or more of the components on the page.
   #. Add fun, coding related images, figures, or gifs to the page.
