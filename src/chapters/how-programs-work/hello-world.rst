Your First Program
===================
We haven’t learned how to code yet, but we can still write and run our first
program. This exercise asks you to create and run small amounts of code, and it
reinforces the LaunchCode principle of learning by doing.

We have used the phrase ``Hello, World`` as an example throughout this chapter
because it represents the traditional first program for a new coder. Printing a
single message is one of the simplest tasks a program can carry out.

``Hello, World`` will be your first program as well. Welcome to the club!

.. note::

   Throughout this book, you will need to access a code editor to complete
   practice problems, exercises, studios and assignments. If you have not
   already done so, create a new account for
   `Repl.it <https://repl.it/login?goto=%2Frepls>`__. The site provides a free
   space to practice coding.

How to Use Repl.it
-------------------

The following screenshot provides an outline for the online code editor that we
will use for many of our examples in this course.

   :alt: Repl.it code editor layout

#. File panel: Click to add, delete, or select different files.
#. Editor panel: Your code goes here. 

Follow this `Hello World link <https://repl.it/@launchcode/HelloWorldJS>`__ to
begin your journey. In the editor, type:

   ``console.log('Hello, World!');``

When you finish typing, click the green "Run" button and observe the output.

.. admonition:: Warning

   Do NOT just copy/paste the code. You will learn best by typing, trying,
   changing, and fixing.

If you typed correctly, you saw the output ``Hello, World!`` If you omitted or
mistyped any characters, then you either saw a misspelled output or an error
message with some tips on what might have gone wrong. Do not worry if you make
mistakes! These experiences still teach you something. Fix any errors and try
again.

Once you print ``Hello, World!`` successfully, go back and play around with the
code. Make a change, click "Run", and see what happens. Try to:

#. Change the message that is printed.
#. Figure out what the parentheses do. Will the code work without them?
#. Remove one or both quotation marks. Do we need to include both opening and
   closing quote marks? Is there a difference between using ``"`` and ``'``?
#. Remove the semi-colon, ``;``.
#. Print a number. (Bonus: Print two numbers added together).
#. Print multiple messages one after the other.
#. Print two messages on the same line.
#. Print a message that contains quote marks, such as ``Quoth the Raven
   "Nevermore"``.
#. Other. You choose!

Spend a few minutes trying these changes. Once done, you will have a pretty
good idea of how the ``console.log`` function in JavaScript works.

.. admonition:: Try It

   On paper (or in a document on your computer), write one or two sentences about
   ``console.log``. You should provide more detail than, “It prints things.”

.. admonition:: Question

   than one valid option.

   a. ``console.log(Coding Rocks)``
   b. ``console.log(Coding Rocks);``
   c. ``console.log('Coding Rocks')``
   d. ``console.log("Coding Rocks');``
   e. ``console.log("Coding Rocks");``
