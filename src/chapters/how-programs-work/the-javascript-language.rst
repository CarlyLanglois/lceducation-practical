The JavaScript Language
========================

Each programming language has its own collection of advantages, drawbacks,
conveniences, and annoying quirks. Certain tasks fit one particular language
better than the others, but many tasks run equally well regardless of the
platform.

.. index:: ! front end

**JavaScript** is no better or worse than any other programming language.
However, it is the only language that runs natively in web browsers. JavaScript
works on the **front end**---meaning it runs inside a browser window. The code
is loaded at the same time as a web page, and it allows programmers to make
instant changes to the page as the user moves the pointer, types on the
keyboard, or clicks the mouse. Validating user input before clicking a "Submit"
button, changing the color of the background by hitting the "p" key, or
creating sparkly trails that follow the mouse pointer are some examples of
using JavaScript to make a *responsive* and *dynamic* environment.

.. index:: ! Back end

**Back end** languages like Python, C#, and Java run on separate servers rather
than inside the browser. These languages can also create interactive web pages,
but changes only occur after data is sent to the server, manipulated and then
returned to the browser. To see the new format, the page must refresh. While
the changes can be rapid and mimic the features provided by JavaScript,
certain immediate tasks (like the sparkly trails) are best accomplished on the
front end.

Just as Python can mimic some front end features, JavaScript can be used as an
alternative to a back end language. However, for tasks that require large sets
of data or perform heavy calculations, using JavaScript is not the best choice.
It tends to bog down as a process gets more complex.

Proposed Revision
-----------------

JavaScript is just one of many programming languages, which serve different purposes. Programmers mainly use JavaScript for web development. JavaScript is such a good language for web development because it can run inside a web browser. 

When code runs inside a web browser, the code is run at the same time as your web page is loaded. This cool feature is why programmers use JavaScript to update your profile when you post a status or change the color of the “Submit” button when you have filled out a form. All of those changes to what you see on the web page are part of front end development.

Back end development involves passing data to and from web pages to servers. JavaScript can be used for back end development, but other languages like Java and C# are industry standards for it. In the case of you filling out a form online, back end code transfers the information you submitted to the company storing your information. That information will then live on the company’s servers.

The ins and outs of how the internet works will be covered throughout this book. While important to understand why we are learning JavaScript, we won’t quiz you on servers and front end development now!
