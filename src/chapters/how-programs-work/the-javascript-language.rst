The JavaScript Language
========================

.. index:: JavaScript

**JavaScript** is one of many programming languages, each of which serves
different purposes. Programmers mainly use JavaScript for web development.
JavaScript is very good at this because it is the only language that runs
inside a web browser. This means that the code loads at the same time as a web
page.

.. index:: ! front end

This cool feature allows programmers to immediately update your profile when
you post a status or change the color of the “Submit” button when you have
filled out a form. All of the changes to what you see on the web page are
part of **front end** development. They are present on your computer.

.. index:: ! Back end

**Back end** development involves passing data between web pages and servers.
JavaScript can be used for back end development, but other languages like Java
and C# are industry standards. When you fill out a form online and click
"Submit", back end code transfers the information you entered to the company
that posted the form. Your information now exists on the company’s servers.

The ins and outs of how the internet works will be covered throughout this
book. While important to understand why we are learning JavaScript, we won’t
quiz you on servers and front end development now!
