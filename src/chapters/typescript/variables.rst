Declaring and Using Variables
=============================

Since TypeScript is statically typed, the type of value is added to the variable declaration. However, we will still use our ``let`` and ``const`` keywords where appropriate.

The general format of a variable declaration is:

.. sourcecode:: js

   let variableName: type = value;

``number``
----------

When declaring a variable and using the ``number`` type, we add ``number`` to the variable declaration, like so:

.. sourcecode:: js

   let variableName: number = 10;

``string``
----------

When declaring a ``string``, we want to use the ``string`` keyword.

.. sourcecode:: js

    let variableName: string = "10":

``boolean``
-----------

The ``boolean`` keyword should be used when declaring a variable of the ``boolean`` type.

.. sourcecode:: js

    let variableName: boolean = true;
