Data Format
===========

In order for our application to make a request to an API, the data will need to be formatted in a way both our application and the API can understand.

The API may have been built with another programming language, and it may not use the same variables, objects, and data structures as JavaScript. To solve the issue of APIs being built in different programming languages Data Formats are used.

A Data Format is a set of rules followed to create data that can be understood by any programming language.

There are quite a few different data formats, but we will only focus on one throughout this class: JavaScript Object Notation, also known as JSON.
