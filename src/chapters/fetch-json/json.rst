FINAL THOUGHTS

When we make a request to an API, the API formats the data we requested into JSON, and then responds to our request with the JSON representation of our request.

JSON is one of the leading data formats used in web development, and is the data format we will use throughout this course. In the next section we will show you how to use the ``fetch()`` method to make a request to an API that will return a JSON representation of the data we requested.
