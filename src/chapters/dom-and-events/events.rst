Events
======

.. index:: ! event

Have you ever thought about how programs respond to interactions from users and other
programs? Programming languages use events to represent these interactions. **Events**
are code representations of interactions that need to be responded to.


Triggering vs Handling
----------------------
Events in programming are sent and responded to. That can also be said as
"Events in progarmming are triggered and handled". **Triggering** an event is
the act of causing an event to be sent. **Hanlding** an event is receiving the
event and performing some action in response.


JavaScript and Events
---------------------

.. index:: ! event-driven

JavaScript is an event-driven progarmming language. **Event-driven** is a programming
pattern where the flow of the program is determined by a series of events. JavaScript
uses events to handle user interaction and make web pages dynamic. JavaScript also uses
events to know when the state of the web page components change.


DOM and Events
--------------
Running JavaScript in the browser requires a specific set of events that relate to loading,
styling, and displaying HTML elements. Objects in the DOM have event handling built right
by default.
