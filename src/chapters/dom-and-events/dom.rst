The DOM
=======
.. index:: ! DOM

In JavaScript you can define classes to represent specific entities. An instance of a class is called
an instance. The **Document Object Model (DOM)** is a set of objects that represent the browser, HTML
document, and all the elements on the page. The DOM objects are instances of classes that model the
structure of the browser, HTML document, HTML elements, element attributes, and CSS.

Dynamic Web Page Using the DOM
------------------------------
Sometimes it is necessary to update a web page based on user interaction.
Remember that static web pages do not change after they are loaded and dynamic web pages can be dynamically updated.

The DOM plays a key part in making web pages dynamic. Since the DOM is a code version of the web page you can write code
to alter the web page. The browser will re-render the web page anytime changes made via the DOM.
