Studio: Angular, Part 1
===============================

Angular allows us to build webpages in small pieces, which keeps us organized
and allows us to focus on one thing at a time.

In this chapter, we learned about the Angular file structure, templates, and
components. Let's put these concepts into practice. Over the next three
classes, we will build a Mission Planning Dashboard using our Angular skills.

Throughout the next three classes we will be building a Mission Planning
Dashboard to practice our Angular skills.

Mission Planning Dashboard
--------------------------

A useful and common front end application is a *dashboard*. It shows quick
information about a topic, so individuals using the web app can be well
informed and make good decisions.

We will create a Space Mission Planning Dashboard.

This Angular project needs to include five sections:
    #. A header that displays the mission and rocket name,
    #. A list that displays the names of the crew,
    #. A list that displays crew member roles,
    #. A list that displays required equipment,
    #. A list that displays the countries represented by the crew.

Each section needs to be it's own component, and they all need to be placed
within the ``app`` folder.

In the next two studios we will learn how to expand this project by using more
Angular tools that will make the application more interactive. For the purposes
of today's studio our web application will not be interactive, and will simply
display static information.

Project Data
------------

Data you will need for this project:
   #. Mission name: Apollo 11
   #. Rocket name: Saturn V
   #. Crew member names & roles: Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot
      Michael Collins, Lunar Module Pilot Buzz Aldrin
   #. Equipment: Command Module, Lunar Module, 3 flight suits, 2 moon suits, 30
      meals, 100 litres of water
   #. Countries: United States

If you need a reminder on how to create components and organize them using the
app component work through the :ref: `` again.

Bonus Mission
-------------

Add some CSS to change add different colors, fonts, borders, etc. to your
dashboard.

Add links to information pages about the different countries represented by
the crew.

Be creative!  Make your webpage look good.
