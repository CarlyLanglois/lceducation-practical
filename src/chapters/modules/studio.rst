Studio: Combating Imposter Syndrome
====================================

There is a widely recognized condition called **Impostor Syndrome**. First
described in the 1970s, it refers to a situation where someone doubts their
accomplishments, and they fear that their success is the result of "faking it".
People experiencing imposter syndrome ignore external evidence of their skills,
and they attribute their success to luck.

At this point in their learning journey, many LC101 students feel doubt about
their prospects. However, they have PLENTY of company---supreme court justice
Sonia Sotomayor, Serena Williams, Tom Hanks, and multiple CEOs have all
questioned their success.

The struggle is real, and an open conversation often helps.

You CAN
--------

First, a little perspective. Identify which of the following tasks you have
already done or know that you can accomplish:

#. Use code to print "Hello, World" to the screen.
#. Define, initialize, change, and use variables.
#. Convert the string ``'1234'`` into a number.
#. Construct a ``for`` loop to repeat a task 100 times.
#. Construct ``if/else if/else`` statements to decide which of three tasks to
   perform.
#. Build, modify, and access an array.
#. Design and call a function.
#. Call one function from within another function.
#. Find and fix bugs in a segment of non-working code.

How many of the 9 items listed above did you indicate? There is no 'passing'
score for this. Whether you checked all 9 or only 1 or 2, simply saying, *I can
do that*, means you have more coding skill than the bulk of the world's
population.

Doubt and uncertainty are normal, especially when exploring a new career.
However, with the skills you already know, you can legitimately say, *I am a
coder*. Combined with the skills you will learn during the rest of the course,
there can be no doubt. You ARE NOT pretending.

Discussion
-----------

Take a few moments in the studio to consider, share, and discuss the following:

#. Have you ever felt the effects of Imposter Syndrome? When?
#. Have you ever responded to a compliment by diminishing the work that earned
   you the praise? If so, why did you answer in that way?
#. How do you feel in a test/quiz/studio when someone finishes much earlier
   than you?
#. What are you most proud of from your time working in LC101?
#. What are your strengths?
#. What gives you confidence?
#. How can you use your effort and strengths to boost your confidence?

Real World Comments
--------------------

#. "We all have impostor syndrome. Every creative person at the top of their
   field will admit to it. And, frankly, getting notoriety for what you do only
   accentuates your feeling of being a fraud… because… you know how stupid you
   are, how lazy you are.” – *Adam Savage, one of the hosts from Mythbusters*

#. "I thought it was a fluke. I thought everybody would find out, and they’d
   take it back. They’d come to my house, knocking on the door, 'Excuse me, we
   meant to give that to someone else. That was going to Meryl Streep.'"
   - *Jodie Foster after winning an Oscar for Best Actress*

#. "Very few people, whether you’ve been in that job before or not, get into
   the seat and believe today that they are now qualified to be the CEO.
   They’re not going to tell you that, but it’s true." - *Starbucks CEO Howard
   Schultz admitting to being insecure*

#. "Feeling a little uncomfortable with your skills is a sign of learning, and
   continuous learning is what the tech industry thrives on! It’s important to
   seek out environments where you are supported, but where you have the chance
   to be uncomfortable and learn new things." - *Vanessa Hurst, Co-Founder of
   Girl Develop It*

Helpful Tips
-------------

Imposter syndrome is real and common. However, there are things you can do to
help boost your confidence:

#. *Acknowledge the thoughts*, especially when you enter a new point in your
   life. Recognize that your feelings are normal.
#. *Put it into perspective*. You have been in LC101 for 4 - 5 weeks. It is OK
   if you do not understand everything on Stack Overflow or recognize all the
   details about the latest technology.
#. *Review your accomplishments*. Think about your life prior to JavaScript
   when *string*, *object* and *function* all meant something much simpler.
   Your learning has been real!
#. *Share with a trusted friend, teacher or mentor*. Other people with more
   experience can provide reassurance, and they probably felt similar doubts
   when they started.
#. *Accept compliments*. Luck did not earn you your tech job. There were LOTS
   of candidates, and you shined enough to set you apart. If someone
   compliments your effort or the quality of your work, graciously accept.
#. *Teach*. This is a great way to reinforce your learning, and it helps you
   recognize how much you know.
#. *Remember the power of 'Yet'*. You are not the master of all skills, of
   course, but you do know how to learn. With more practice, you will fill in
   any gaps in your knowledge.
