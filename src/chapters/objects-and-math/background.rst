Objects and Why They Matter
===========================

Understand objects as collections of properties that are key/value
Pairs
 FOCUS on objects as data storage

----------------------

Understand that a property of an object stores a value, while a method performs an action (e.g. a method is a property that stores a function).
Understand object values as references, and how that affects
comparisons between objects
