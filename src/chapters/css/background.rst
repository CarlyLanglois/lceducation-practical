What is CSS?
============

As discussed in the previous chapter, HTML lays out the structure of a document and does little else. While that is important, it can make some websites appear pretty bland. Where are all of the fun colors and cool fonts?

That is where Cascading Style Sheets (or CSS) come in! CSS is a style sheet language that allows programmers to add styling to their content in web pages.

With CSS, programmers can change background and font colors, the size of different elements, and many more things.
