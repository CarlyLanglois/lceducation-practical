What is a terminal?
===================

Most of the time when we interact with our computers, we do so through a 
**graphical user interface**, or **GUI** for short. A GUI is a system designed
with icons and visual representations of the machine's file systems. Programmers
also frequently use another kind of interface called the **command line**. A **CLI**,
or command line interface, uses text, rather than graphic manipulation, to give the
computer instructions. The program responsible for running a CLI and interpreting the 
instructions is often referred to as a **terminal**, or **shell**.
