Exercises: Angular, Part 3
===========================

Intro text here...

Starter Code
-------------

The starter code for the exercises is in the same
`repository <https://github.com/LaunchCodeEducation/angular-lc101-projects>`__
that you cloned for the all of the Angular lessons.

From the ``lesson3`` folder in VSCode, navigate into the
``exercises/src/app/component-name`` folder. Open the
``component-name.component.html`` and ``component-name.component.ts`` files.

In the terminal, navigate into the lesson 3 ``exercises`` folder. Enter
``npm install`` to add the Angular modules, then run ``ng serve``. When you
open the webpage in your browser, it should look like this:

Add Attribute Directives

For ``style``, ``class``, ``value``, etc.

Add Events to Modify Directives

Maybe enable/disable buttons based on whether ``cargoHold`` is full?

Enable ``Launch`` button when all checks pass?

Fly the Rocket?
----------------
