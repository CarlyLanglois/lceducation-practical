Angular Wrap-Up
================

Over the past three chapters, you have learned:

#. What *templates* are and why we want to use them,
#. How to use the Angular CLI to create a new project, generate new components,
   and run a project locally in your web browser.
#. How to define custom HTML tags and use them to arrange components within a
   template.
#. How to use the *structural directives* ``*ngFor`` and ``*ngIf`` to
   automatically generate HTML elements and display dynamic content.
#. How to catch events and set up data-binding to make your webpage respond to
   user actions.
#. How to use *attribute directives* to modify the appearance and behavior of
   specific HTML elements.

Tip of the Iceberg
-------------------

The Angular skills you learned are a small slice of what the framework can
accomplish. They provide a solid foundation if you choose to learn more on your
own.

You can find full documentation on the `Angular.io <https://angular.io/>`__
website. A good "next step" for your Angular learning would be to complete the
`Tour of Heros <https://angular.io/tutorial>`__ tutorial project.

More coming soon...

The Angular documentation is excruciatingly complete, but do not be
intimidated. There are plenty of separate tutorial sites that cover individual
skills and techniques. When you find an interesting topic on the Angular site,
feel free to Google that topic and explore how other coders explain how to use
it.
