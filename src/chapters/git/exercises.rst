Exercises: Git
==============

Working in a Local Repository
-----------------------------

We will use our new terminal powers to move through the Git exercises.

#. In whichever directory you are keeping your coursework, make a new directory called ``Git-Exercises`` using the ``mkdir`` command. 
#. Inside the ``Git-Exercises`` directory, initialize a new Git repository using ``git init``.
#. Use ``git branch`` to check the default branch name. If necessary, change the
   branch name to ``main``.
#. Add a file called ``exercises.txt`` using the ``touch`` command in the terminal.
#. Commit your local changes using the ``git commit`` procedures.
#. Add ``"Hello World!"`` to the file called ``exercises.txt``.
#. Commit your local changes following the same steps that you used for step 5.
#. Run the ``git log`` command. Take a screenshot of the result. Make note of
   what you see!

Setting up a Github Account
---------------------------

For our remote repositories, we will be using `GitHub <https://github.com/>`__. 

To create your account, follow these steps:

#. Navigate to GitHub's site using the link above.
#. Sign up for an account on the homepage either by filling out the form or clicking the "Sign Up" button.
#. Once you have an account, you are ready to store your remote work.

.. todo:: Add instructions for setting up a GitHub SSH key and/or PAT.
