Exercises: Git
==============

Working in a Local Repository
-----------------------------

We will use our new terminal powers to move through the Git exercises.

1. In whichever directory you are keeping your coursework, make a new directory called ``Git-Exercises`` using the ``mkdir`` command. 
2. Inside the ``Git-Exercises`` directory, initialize a new Git repository using ``git init``.
3. Add a file called ``exercises.txt`` using the ``touch`` command in the terminal.
4. Commit your local changes using the ``git commit`` procedures.
5. Add "Hello World!" to the file called ``exercises.txt``.
6. Commit your local changes following the same steps that you used for step 4.
7. View and screenshot the result when you use ``git log``. Make note of what you see!

Setting up a Github Account
---------------------------

For our remote repositories, we will be using `Github <https://github.com/>`_. 

To create your account, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Github's site using the link above.
2. Sign up for an account on the homepage either by filling out the form or clicking the "Sign Up" button.
3. Once you have an account, you are ready to store your remote work.
